# Physics Class

This Python script contains various functions for physics calculations, including temperature conversions, force calculations, energy calculations, and work calculations.

## Functions

1. `f_to_c(f_temp)`: Converts Fahrenheit to Celsius
2. `c_to_f(c_temp)`: Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit
3. `get_force(mass, acceleration)`: Calculates force using mass and acceleration
4. `get_energy(mass, c=3*10**8)`: Calculates energy using mass and the speed of light
5. `get_work(mass, acceleration, distance)`: Calculates work done

## Usage

The script demonstrates the usage of these functions with example calculations for:
- Temperature conversions
- Force calculation for a train
- Energy calculation for a bomb
- Work calculation for a train

## Variables

- `train_mass`: Mass of the train (22680 units)
- `train_acceleration`: Acceleration of the train (10 units)
- `train_distance`: Distance traveled by the train (100 units)
- `bomb_mass`: Mass of the bomb (1 unit)

## Output

The script prints the results of various calculations to the console.

## Note

This script is part of a physics class exercise and demonstrates basic physics concepts and calculations.
